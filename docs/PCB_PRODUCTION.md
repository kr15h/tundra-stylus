# PCB Production

An essential component of the Tundra Stylus is its button board with 4 buttons.

There are four cable pairs connecting the pads on the board with the Tundra Stylus IO Expansion board that is placed under the Tundra Stylus itself.

The cables are connected to the PCB in the following order (starting from the tip of the stylus upward).

1. Trigger
2. Grip
3. Trackpad
4. Menu

The names of the buttons might make you think that some of them can sense pressure, but all of them are plain digital IO buttons. You will need to cut them shorter, but try to leave a bit of extra in case you mess something up.
