# Contributing

There are three ways how you can contribute.

1. Report bugs by submitting and issue.
2. Suggest improvements by submitting an issue.
3. Fix or add things yourself by submitting a pull request.

Before submitting new things, take a look at the project roadmap or submit an issue first. Let's discuss the idea first.
