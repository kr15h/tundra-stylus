# BOM

Tundra Stylus would not be possible without a list of core off-the-shelve components. 

- [Tundra Tracker](https://tundra-labs.com/products/additional-tracker)
- [Tundra Tracker IO Expansion Board](https://tundra-labs.com/products/tundra-tracker-io-expansion-board)
- [VIVE Base Station](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/base-station2/) (2pcs is optimal, but you can get up to 4 for ultra fidelity tracking)


## Tools

- 3D printer. I used Prusa MK4.
- PCB milling machine. I used Bungard CCD/2 MTC.
- Soldering station.
- Screwdriver.

[^1]: It is up to you what PLA type and manufacturer you choose. I printed with filament from 3dk.berlin on Prusa MK4 printers at the Aalto Fablab.

[^2]: The weight here is the avaiable spool size as it would be probably hard to purchase an exact amount.

[^3]: This is if you choose to do PCB milling at a fablab. Of course you can use FR4, but it is at your own risk. 

[^4]: Bungard is the manuacturer and you should contact them to find out distributors in your country.
