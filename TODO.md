# TODO

A shortlist of reminders what I wanted to do when I last touched the code.

- [x] Update Tundra stylus to provide tip position as main position
- [x] Also provide tracker position and rotation as secondary values
- [x] Adjust the rest of the code to reflect changes
- [ ] Make stylus return absolute positions only and handle origin in scene or App
